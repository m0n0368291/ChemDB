___

This is a learning by doing project to help me learn to code. My goal is to write an application in python that lets you transfer your data from a single excel sheet file to an SQLite3 database. The data is meant to be information about the chemicals your lab is using like where they are, what their quantity is etc. Also i want to introduce a *flag system*, where one can set chemicals as *missing* or in use by someone. This is due to the way chemicals are stored and used in the laboratory i work at. If this doesn't make sense to you feel free to contact me.
