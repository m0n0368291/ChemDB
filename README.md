# ChemDB
---
## Features
- [x] graphical user interface with periodic table as search mask
- [x] SQLite3 database for efficient storage of compound data
- [ ] Management of compounds within the gui
- [ ] additional compound data to boost working efficiency (planning in progress)
- [x] using a shared database with multiple "clients" (no user accounts)

## Getting started
- Install Python 3.X and Git from official sources like [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) or [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- clone into this repository with ``git clone https://github.com/m0n0368291/ChemDB.git``
- execute ``main.py`` by typing ``python main.py`` into the command-line, after navigating into the folder containing the repository

## Database Schema
*coming soon*

## Notes
- **There is no release yet! Expect functions to be not working at all!**
- **at the moment the database is still hardcoded into ``main.py``, so opening a database with the button has no effect!**

## How to contribute
Contribution is not planned for this project (yet).
